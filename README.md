# 2 Player Drawing Game With Websockets and JavaScript!

Welcome! In this drawing game, you work with a partner to create two separate characters. You will draw one half of the character while your partner will draw the other half. Here's the catch: you will not be able to see the other half until after you have finished drawing!

This is being implemented with [socket.io](https://socket.io/), and [express](https://expressjs.com/) using javascript, css, and html.
